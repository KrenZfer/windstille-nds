Windstille-NDS
==============

Windstille-NDS is a version of Windstille[1] for the NintendoDS. The
codebase was written from scratch and not based on the regular
Windstille release. The game never got finished, so it's little more
then a very rought prototype.

The prototype features a single room in which one can walk and
interact with a door on a vehicle. The touchscreen provides some
clickability as well.

A video of the game in action can be found on Youtube:

The `roms/` directory contains precompiled NintendoDS roms. They will
run on a NintendoDS emulator like `desmume`.
